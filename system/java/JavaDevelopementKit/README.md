## CJDK (Custom Java Development Kit) (Apple Pie Linux edition)
# What is CJDK Apple Pie Linux edition?
This CJDK for Apple Pie Linux is meant for this OS because no one made a JDK and JRE for this OS. 
So, we are making our own JDK and JRE. If you want to help ❤️ then great!
Just commit and if you make a pull request or issue, then good!
